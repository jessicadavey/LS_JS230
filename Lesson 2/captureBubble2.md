# Practice Problems - Capturing and Bubbling 2

## Practice Problem 1:

1. `click` event listener of the div element listening on the bubbling phase - alerts `target`
2. `click` event listener of the div element listening on the bubbling phase - alerts `currentTarget`

## Practice Problem 2:

1. `click` event listener on element 1 that alerts `capturing` during the capturing phase
2. `click` event listener on element 1 that alerts `bubbling` during the bubbling phase

## Practice Problem 3:

1. `click` event listener on element 1, bubbling phase, with element 1 as target
2. `keypress` event listener on document, bubbling phase
3. `keypress` event listener on document, bubbling phase
4. `click` event listener on element 1, bubbling phase, with element 4 as target
